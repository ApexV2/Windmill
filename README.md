# Windmill - Data Stream Processor

Windmill is a real-time data processing tool designed to collect, filter, and analyze continuous streams of data. Whether you're working with IoT sensor data, stock market feeds, or other real-time data sources, Windmill efficiently manages the flow, enabling you to respond to events as they happen. 

## Features

- **Real-time Data Collection**: Continuously collect data from various streams like IoT devices, financial feeds, or logs.
- **Data Filtering**: Apply filters to isolate relevant data, reducing noise from unnecessary information.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Perform analytics on incoming data streams for instant insights.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale across multiple data streams and nodes.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamless integration with databases, messaging systems, or data storage platforms.
- **Fault-tolerant**: Handles network interruptions or node failures gracefully without losing data.

## Use Cases

1. **IoT Data Processing**: Collect sensor data from connected devices and filter, analyze, and react to changes in real time.
2. **Stock Market Analysis**: Process and analyze stock market feeds to detect trends and make decisions instantly.
3. **Log Monitoring**: Continuously monitor log streams and trigger alerts based on specific patterns or anomalies.
4. **Real-time Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data from multiple sources for reporting or further processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
